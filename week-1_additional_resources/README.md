# Week 1 Additional Resources

## Learning Objectives

* Problem Solving
  * Craft a clear, concise coding question to a more experienced developer.
  * Research unknown JavaScript code syntax using MDN.
  * Identify and fix a bug in code based on an error message.
  * Manage your time and stress at App Academy.
* Expressions
  * Given a working REPL interface, write and execute a statement that will print “hello world” using console.log
  * Identify that strings are a list of characters defined by using double or single quotes
  * Given an arithmetic expression using `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, `%`, compute its value
  * Given an expression, predict if its value is NaN
  * Construct the truth tables for `&&`, `||`, `!`
  * Given an expression consisting of `>`, `>=`, `===`, `<`, `<=`, compute it’s value
  * Apply De Morgan’s law to a boolean expression
  * Given an expression that utilizes operator precedence, compute its value
  * Given an expression, use the grouping operator to change it’s evaluation
  * Given expressions using == and ===, compute their values
  * Given a code snippet using postfix ++, postfix --, +=, -=, /=, *=, predict the value of labeled lines
  * Create and assign a variable using let to a string, integer, and a boolean. Read its value and print to the console.
* Strings
  * Describe the properties of a string
  * Create a string
  * Find the length of a string
  * Find the character at a certain index in a string
  * Concatenate two strings together
  * Find the first instance of a character in a string
  * Create a new string from a sub-section of another string
* Arrays
  * Describe the properties of an array
  * Create an array
  * Find the length of an array
  * Find and/or change the element at a certain index in an array
  * Find the first instance of an element in an array
  * Create a new array from a sub-section of another array
  * Add or remove elements from the front or the back of an array
* Functions
  * Define a function using function declaration.
  * Define a function that calculates the average of two numbers, call it, pass in arguments, and print its return value.
  * Identify the difference between parameters vs arguments.
  * Define and use a helper function to solve a function's sub-problem
* Control Flow
  * Define a function that accepts a sentence string and two words as args. The function should return a boolean indicating if the sentence includes either word.
  * Identify a pair of mutually exclusive conditions.
  * Given a for loop, translate it into a while loop, and vice-versa.
  * Write a function that iterates through a provided string argument.
  * Write a function that takes in an array of words and a string as arguments and returns a boolean indicating whether the string is located inside of the array. The function must use Array's `.indexOf()` method.
  * Define that an array literal is an ordered list of values defined by using bracket and individual values are read by indexing.
