Given multiple plausible reasons, identify why functions are called “First Class Objects” in JavaScript. (can be assigned to a variable, can be arguments, can be a return value)
Given a code snippet containing an anonymous callback, a named callback, and multiple console.logs, predict what will be printed
Write a function that takes in a value and two callbacks. The function should return the result of the callback that is greater.
Write a function, myMap, that takes in an array and a callback as arguments. The function should mimic the behavior of Array#map.
Write a function, myFilter, that takes in an array and a callback as arguments. The function should mimic the behavior of Array#filter.
Write a function, myEvery, that takes in an array and a callback as arguments. The function should mimic the behavior of Array#every.
