## `W2D2 - Pair Programming, POJOs`

### `Pair Programming`
a/A's pair programming process:
* Introduce yourselves and have a little small talk
* Decide who will start on being a navigator/driver
* Set a STRICT 15 minute timer
* At the end of the 15 minutes, switch roles
* If you are collaborating and communicating well, the switch should be seamless

**If you are both stuck and need a few extra minutes to talk about implementation, pause the timer, talk it through, and then start again!**

### `Why is Pair Programming Important?`
In a technical interview, you're going to have to explain your thought process when solving an algorithm or talking about system design. 

The question may be very abstract and your line of questioning/communicating might be what pushes you to the next round of interviews. 

Having excellent verbal and interpersonal skills will have the interviewer rooting for you to succeed.  

## `The object Type`
* A data structure that holds a collection of items. Each item has a key, and a value pairing.

* `Keys` are strings and they are unique 

* `Values` can be any data type! 

* **P.O.J.O.** => `P`lain` O`ld `J`avaScript

    bool: false,
}
```

## `Destructuring: Arrays and Objects`
- Arrays:

let array = ['red', 'orange', 'yellow'];
ket [ c1, c2 ] = array;
console.log(c1, c2)
```
