- [forEach Demo]
- [map Demo]
- [filter Demo]
- [reduce Demo]

`forEach`

  ```js
  /* 
  Write a function called hello that intakes an 
  array of names and prints "Hello," plus the name, for
  each name. Must use .forEach()

  hello(['Mylo', 'Buster']) prints 'Hello, Mylo', 'Hello, Buster'
  */
  ```

`map`

  ```js
  /* 
  Write a function called timesTwo that intakes an
  array of numbers and returns a new array where all 
  of the numbers are multiplied by 2. You must use .map()

  timesTwo([1, 2, 3]) => [2, 4, 6]
  timesTwo([-1, 6, 0]) => [-2, 12, 0]
  */
  ```

`filter`

  ```js
  /* 
  Write a function called evens that intakes an
  array of numbers and returns a new array of only the
  even numbers from the original array. You must use
  .filter()

  evens([1, 2, 3]) => [2]
  evens([42, 44, 45]) => [42, 44]
  */
  ```

`reduce`

  ```js
  /* 
  Write a function called sum that intakes an
  array of names and returns a string of "Names: " with
  all of the names attached after. Must use the .reduce()

  reduce(['Mylo']) => Names: Mylo 
  reduce(['Rick', 'Morty']) => Names: Rick Morty 
  */
  ```

## Mocha

- Mocha is the testing suite we will use to test our code
  - let's download today's project and see how it works
