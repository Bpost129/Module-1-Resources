# Module 1 Resources

## Welcome to Module 1

Here you will find all resources that are associated to your cohort during \
your time in Module 1!

## Folder Structure

App Academy suggest the following folder structure to say organized during \
  the course.

- `app_academy` (**folder**)
- `Module-1-Resources` (**folder**)
- `week_1` (**folder**)
  - `w1d1` (**folder**)
    - `lecture`(**folder**)
      - `README.md`
      - ...
    - `projects` (**folder**)
      - `file1.js` (**file**)
      - `file2.js` (**file**)
      - ...
    - `homework` (**folder**)
      - `file1.js` (**file**)
      - `file2.js` (**file**)
      - ...

You can very easily achieve this file structure for weeks 1 - 3 by running

```bash
curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/appacademy/Module-1-Resrouces/main/additional_resources/run.sh | bash
```
