# Module 1 Resources

## Welcome to Module 1

Here you will find all resources that are associated to your cohort during \
your time in Module 1!

## Folder Structure (ONCE)

You can very easily achieve the folder/file structure we're expecting in Mod1 \
by running the following command

```bash
curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/appacademy/Module-1-Resources/main/additional_resources/scripts/folder_structure.sh | bash
```

## Updating this repo (DAILY)

You can get the most up-to-date lecture material every morning by running the \
following command, and input the current week number and day number!\
This will copy the newest lecture material to your `appacademy` folder so you\
can code along and take notes.

```bash
aa_update
```

## Lectures

- Each lecture has notes and coding examples that you should follow along with. \
The lecture notes for the day will be called `README.md` and its associated \
code will be linked within the `README.md`. Just like this:

  - [Code it out](./w1/d1/code_it_out/boolean-type.js)

## Additional Resources

- Feel free to explore and find some helpful resources that may include things \
like cheat sheets and additional practice problems and general advice.
